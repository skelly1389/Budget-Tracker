# Budget-Tracker

## Description

I don't get any cell service at my local grocery story but it'd still be nice to be able to track my spending, therefore a budget app that keeps track of user input while offline and fills in the gaps when a connection is re-created would be extremely useful. Combining the built in indexeddb api with a web manifest and service worker allows the application to function correctly after only loading online once.
